# Monte-Carlo-Poker Simulations
Calculates the probability of winning a texas holdem poker round given starting hand. Can factor for number of players. Admittedly, it does not scale well because of the number of simulations and hands dealt needed to accommodate poker's seemingly infinite number of possibilities is, well, a lot.

Current scripts accurately creates hands and simulates rounds. Regarding the winning percentage, the values are close to verified ones (of course it'll never be exact) but I want to further test before becoming confident.
