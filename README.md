# Monte-Carlo-Poker Simulations
Calculates the probability of winning a texas holdem poker round given starting hand. Can factor for number of players. Admittedly, it does not scale well because of the number of simulations and hands dealt needed to accommodate poker's seemingly infinite number of possibilities is, well, a lot.

Current file accurately creates hands. Based on probability calculated from Monte Carlo simulations, the accessed winning probability is close to verified values (of course it'll never be exact) but I want to further verify before becoming confident.
